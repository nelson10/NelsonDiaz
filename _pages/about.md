Nelson Diaz received the B.Sc. (Eng.) degree in computer science engineering, the M.Sc. degree in computer science, and the Ph.D. degree in engineering with an emphasis in electronics from the Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, in 2012, 2015, and 2020, respectively.  In autumn-winter 2018-2019, he did an internship with Telecommunications for Space and Aeronautics Laboratory (TéSA), Toulouse, France, funded by Colciencias. Nelson Diaz has published seven papers, most of them in Q1 international journals and ten international conferences.  During his Ph.D. Nelson designed, simulated, and implemented adaptive systems for compressive spectral imaging for different tasks.  Between those tasks are hyperspectral and multispectral image classification, image reconstruction, and video sensing.  The research topics are compressive spectral imaging, adaptive sensing, and video sensing.  Currently, he holds a postdoctoral position at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparíso Chile.  In his postdoc, he is developing sensing schemes for video acquisition.
