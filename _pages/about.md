I got my B.Sc. (Eng.) degree in Computer Science Engineering, the M.Sc. degree in Computer Science, and the Ph.D. degree in Engineering with an emphasis in Electronics from the Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia, in 2012, 2015, and 2020, respectively. In autumn-winter 2018-2019, I did an internship with Telecommunications for Space and Aeronautics Laboratory (TéSA), Toulouse, France, funded by [Minciencias](https://minciencias.gov.co/). During my internship, I developed a new algorithm for cardiac motion estimation in ultrasound imaging under the supervision of Ph.D. [Jean-Yves Tourneret](http://tourneret.perso.enseeiht.fr/). I have published six papers, most of them in Q1 international journals and ten international conferences. During my Ph.D., I designed, simulated, and implemented adaptive systems for compressive spectral imaging for different tasks. Between those tasks are hyperspectral and multispectral image classification, image reconstruction, and video sensing. I was under the supervision of Ph.D. [Henry Arguello](http://hdspgroup.com/). My research topics are compressive spectral imaging, adaptive sensing, and video sensing.  Currently, I hold a postdoctoral position at the Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso, Valparíso Chile.  In my postdoc, I am developing sensing schemes for video and spectral acquisition under the supervision of Ph.D. [Esteban Vera](https://www.pucv.cl/uuaa/escuela-de-ingenieria-electrica/profesores-jornada-completa/esteban-vera-rojas).
