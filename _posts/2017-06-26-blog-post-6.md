======

PhD. student Nelson Diaz participated in the Computational Optical Sensing and Imaging 2017 in San Francisco, California, United States, from the 26th to the 29th of June 2017. Nelson presented a poster entitled "Gradient thresholding algorithm for adaptive colored coded aperture design in compressive spectral imaging" [[Paper]](https://nelson10.github.io/files/Conference05.pdf), [[Link]](https://doi.org/10.1364/3D.2017.JTu5A.4), [[Poster]](https://nelson10.github.io/files/poster2.pdf).
