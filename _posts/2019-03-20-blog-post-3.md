Internship 2018-2019 in Toulouse, France
======

In the fall-winter 2018-2019, I did six-months internship with Telecommunications for Space and Aeronautics Laboratory TèSA, Toulouse, France, funded by <a href="https://minciencias.gov.co/">Minciencias</a>. During my internship, I developed a new algorithm for cardiac motion estimation in ultrasound imaging under the supervision of Dr. Jean-Yves Tourneret and Dr. Adrian Basarab. In 2019 I extended that work to compressive video spectral.
