PostDoctoral internship at High Dimensional Signal Processing Research Group (HDSP), Universidad Industrial de Santander in Bucaramanga, Colombia
======

Between October and December of 2023, Dr. Nelson Diaz with Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV) did a three-month internship in the High Dimensional Signal Processing (HDSP) research group at Universidad Industrial de Santander (UIS), Bucaramanga, Colombia. During the internship, Nelson Diaz worked on a new coding pattern for 3D optimal depth of field by sphere packing (ODFSP). He worked under the mentoring of Dr. Henry Arguello, the leader of the HDSP group whose areas of research are compressive spectral imaging, algorithms, optimization, and the processing of signals in high dimensions. Nelson presented in the HDSP's research seminar his recent journal paper published in the IEEE Transactions on Image Processing entitled Multispectral Filter Array Design by Optimal Sphere Packing.
