PostDoctoral and Doctoral internship at Information Processing Laboratory in Temuco, Chile, 2023
======

In the summer of 2023, Dr. Nelson Diaz and Ph.D. student Alejandro Alvarado, both with Pontificia Universidad Católica de Valparaíso (PUCV) did a two-month internship in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Universidad de la Frontera with Information Processing Laboratory (IPL), Temuco, Chile. During the internship, Nelson Diaz worked on a new coding pattern for 4D-spectral video acquisition using a 4D-sphere packing approach, and Alejandro Alvado performed acquisition and experiments with real data to prove multispectral filter array (MSFA) by a sphere packing approach. They worked under the supervision of Dr. Pablo Meza.
