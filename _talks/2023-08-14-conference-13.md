This work presents a mathematical framework to design 4D-coded aperture (CA)s for compressive snapshot spectral video (SV) exploiting 4D-sphere packing (SP). Simulation results using state-of-the-art datasets and metrics show a promising performance of the proposed approach to capture high-dimensional datacubes with limited sensing resources.
