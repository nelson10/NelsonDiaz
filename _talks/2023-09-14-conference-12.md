This paper introduces a new method to capture compressive spectral video (SV) imaging by exploiting 3-dimensional sphere packing (SP) to design 4D-coded apertures. The proposed approach reconstructs the 4D-hypercube from a single snapshot. Simulations using SV demonstrate the performance of SP approach.
