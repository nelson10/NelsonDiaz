This paper proposes a new motion estimation method based on convolutional sparse coding to adaptively design the colored-coded apertures in static and dynamic spectral videos. The motion in a spectral video is estimated from a low-resolution reconstruction of the datacube by training a convolutional dictionary per spectral band and solving a minimization problem. Simulations show improvements in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (of up to 2 dB) of the reconstructed videos by using the proposed approach, compared with state-of-art non-adaptive coded apertures.
