The new generation of extremely large telescope (ELT) introduces many challenges in optics and engineering. A key challenge is the development of an adaptive optics system able to handle elongated laser guide star (ELGS). Classic wavefront sensor (WFS), such as the shack-hartmann wavefront sensor (SHWFS) or pyramidal wavefront sensor (PyWFS), are not able to readily handle elongated stars, which gets worse when the atmospheric turbulence becomes stronger. In this work, we present a novel complex field wavefront sensor (CFWFS) that can reconstruct the phase and amplitude of the extended bodies at the image plane, and then it is able to recover the turbulent phase at the pupil plane. The proposed WFS scheme uses a four times faster parallel phase retrieval algorithm with only eight designed coded aperture (DCA) that is designed using sphere packing coded apertures (SPCA). We present a collection of encouraging preliminary simulation results.
