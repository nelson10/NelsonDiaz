This work presents a binary coded aperture (CA) design using sphere packing (SP) to determine the number of light entries in a compressive ultrafast photography (CUP) system. Our proposed approach leverages the uniform sensing that yields SP and the temporal shifting induced by the galvanometer to achieve uniform sensing.
