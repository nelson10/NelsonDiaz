I am interested in developing a computational imaging system that improve our understanding of the world. 
In this regard, my research has focused on 3 different subareas. First, \textbf{applied sphere packing for 
single-snapshot spectral imaging/video sensing}, where I have designed and built a \textit{multispectral 
filter array with an optimal sensing distribution} that overcomes the limitations of traditional multispectral filters 
(color distortion, zipper effect, and color artifacts). Moreover, I have developed a novel **shuffled rolling shutter 
camera** that eliminate the nuisance artifacts of the rolling shutter mechanism found in complementary
metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) detectors. Second, \textbf{computational imaging and applied optics} 
where I explore different topics such adaptive compressive spectral imaging sensing to improve the quality 
of spectral image reconstruction, wavefront coding using diffractive optical elements for solving tasks
such as extended-depth-of-field (EDoF), coded aperture design for phase retrieval. Finally, **remote sensing**,
where I have also developed *adaptive compressive multispectral imaging and video acquisition systems* to improve
the image quality and perform specific tasks, such as, classification. I also \textit{developed and implemented
an algorithm for ground filtering using point cloud processing captured using Light Detection and Ranging} (LiDAR).

This research thrusts will have a broad impact on several domains including consumer photography, surveillance, 
remote sensing, target identification, medical applications, and computational imaging, and applied optics.
